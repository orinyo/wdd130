        <h2>Stephen Orinyo</h2>
        <h2>Stevo</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Stephen Orinyo, and you can call me Steve. Originally from Kenya, I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the past 9 years. I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Software Development.</p>
        <p>I am happily married and blessed with one child, who brings immense joy to my life. Although I am currently unemployed and spending more time at home, I see this as an opportunity to invest in my education and future career.</p>
        <p>One of the things I love most about BYU-Idaho is the emphasis on practical learning and career preparation. That's why I've chosen to take the Web Fundamentals class. I believe that learning about careers in web design will equip me with valuable skills in today's digital age, opening up new opportunities in the job market.</p>
        <p>In this course, I hope to gain a solid foundation in web design principles and techniques. I believe this knowledge will not only benefit me professionally but also allow me to contribute to web development projects in my personal life.</p>
        <p>As I progress in my academic journey, I'm excited to connect with fellow students and instructors who share a passion for technology and design. BYU-Idaho's supportive community makes learning here a truly enriching experience.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I find inspiration in the teachings of our church leaders. One of my favorite quotes comes from President Russell M. Nelson: "The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives." This reminds me to prioritize what truly matters in life.</p>
        <p> Lastly, if there's anything else you'd like to know or discuss, feel free to reach out. I'm here to share experiences, learn from others, and make the most of this educational journey.</p>
